Title: Continuous Biomarker Evaluation with Adjustment of Covariates
Version: 0.1.5
Author: Ziyi Li
Maintainer: Ziyi Li <zli16@mdanderson.org>
Description: Compute covariate-adjusted specificity at controlled sensitivity level, or covariate-adjusted sensitivity at controlled specificity level, or covariate-adjust receiver operating characteristic curve, or covariate-adjusted thresholds at controlled sensitivity/specificity level. All statistics could also be computed for specific sub-populations given their covariate values. Methods are described in Ziyi Li, Yijian Huang, Datta Patil, Martin G. Sanda (2021+) "Covariate adjustment in continuous biomarker assessment".
